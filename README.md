# FlappyDino-Pygame: Project made by Bao Tran Huy Duc for TH Hoa Lac Coding Club
The project is about using PyGame to build a small video game combining my favourite aspects of Flappy Bird and Chrome's Dino.
The project took a total of roughly 15 hours to finish.
"Python Flappy Dino.mp4" is a video showing the game when it is run.
